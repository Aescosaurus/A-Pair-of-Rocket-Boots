show controls on first level
show score in corner - turn red for a moment on major score loss
-- disable sprite clipping on rotated things
mars platforms are hard to see against the background - maybe black outline?

Ok so I have two big like game play critiques one is that i feel like I dont get enough power behind a launch
	especially when I'm really like pulling all the way across the screen in my brain atleast when I do that
	I want to be pinging around the stage out of control almost
Second is that it feels like the platforms are just a bit to big with its hit box sometimes I try to slid
	underneath one and I bounce off im sure their sizes are fair but it doesn't feel that way lol
Oh and one last thing is that one a few of those one launch levels it deemed like you had to do the launch mid
	air as you were falling from spawning in which just made it a bit more tedious so maybe some kind of
	smash spawn platform that Lasts for a short time
The launch feels off to me when you shoot the rocket. It feels like it should go much farther than it should when
	I pull all the way back.
And the asteroids during the moon level seem a bit too random


remove limit on jump power - maybe have options slider?
reduce platform hitbox size
maybe player starts going up a bit at the start of the level? or grav takes a sec to register
make asteroids not random
